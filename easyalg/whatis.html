At its most basic level, an algorithm is a roadmap for solving a problem. People create algorithms by thinking about ways to approach a problem, such as sorting objects in a row. Then, to allow computers to execute these algorithms, people create programs in various languages, such as Python, C++, and Java. Programs derived from algorithms are the backbone of nearly every computer process, from simple addition to communication via the Internet.
